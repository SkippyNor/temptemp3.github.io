<p>The net will not crawl itself. Crawlers and bots feeding on fresh information are a living breathing part of the ecosystem we all know as, “The Internet.” They come and go as they please. They almost never come without a lead, which is the motivation for pinging crawlers. Here we will touch on how you may call the Google Bot to crawl your site.</p>

<p><a href="hello-world.html">Hello World</a> and 31 days later but still no index &hellip; <br />
(31 Jul 2017)</p>

<p>Maybe getting your GitHub Pages User Page to show up in search engine results was not initially high on your priority list, but no discovery after more than 30 days, that's just pushing it. Before spending any more time wondering <em>why isn't my page getting discovered?</em>, ask yourself <strong><em>has my site been crawled?</em></strong></p>

<p>If your site has never been crawled, then the probability of your page getting discovered is not high.</p>

<p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>

<p>Now or any time between now and never is the time to <u><strong>call the crawlers</strong></u>.</p>

<p>If you are used to posting through WordPress or another content management system serving as a backend for dynamic content delivery, the task of calling the crawling, or pinging, is automated and handled in the background whenever you update your site.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your site falls into the category of GitHub Pages User Pages, then pinging crawlers needs to be done manually at first and by some means determined at a later date automated in the background.</p>

<p>The easiest way to accomplish this task to simply <u><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url">submit a url</a></u> using the Google Search Console. </p>

<p>You will also learn that there are tools out there that offer to submit url crawl requests to multiple search engines for you. My opinion regarding this matter at the point of time this mini seo post was written, is that "If Google Bot can find it, then sure can the other bots." At least they try.</p>

<p>That is all for today. Maybe in the future there will be a post about how stop submitting urls without affecting the discoverability of your site; or we can go in another direction like why 'seo-pinging-crawlers not found' may not be the best choice in titles out there. </p>

<p>Until then,</p>

<p>Bye</p>
