<hr />

<p>Great programmers are not born. They are made! <br />
Solving coding challenges in <a href="bash.html">bash</a> is a sure way to hone your shell scripting skills and become a better programmer. That is for sure. </p>

<h2>Bash: Coding Challenges to Become a Better Programmer</h2>

<p>I've compiled a depth-first list places to tackle coding challenges of all levels in bash. The list is schedule to grow as soon as enough time is spent evaluating each challenge source, i.e. when the end of the road is reached and it it time to look elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Hackerrank</h3>

<p>With 65 challenges from hello world to text processing, Hackerrank is a good place to start. <br />
Look for Linux Shell. That is where you will find the coding challenges for bash. There are a few neat challenges which I may mention if I have a chance. But for the most part each challenge may be solved with few lines of code and little worry of eating up too much cpu and hard disk space. <br />
I recommend setting up a repository to stash away your solved challenges. As far as I know there are no warning regarding setting up a public repository challenge solutions. If you do decide to make one, don't forget a spoiler alert for courtesy.
Guess what? <br />
When you solve all of the challenges you will be put at the top of the leaderboard. Don’t be surprised if you see your name twice. That's just their way of saying, “Good job!” Thanks, Hackerrank!</p>

<h3>Project Euler</h3>

<p>General coding challenges that can be implemented in the programming language of your choice. Makes good practice for programming in bash. Just run your code and submit the answer to a form. <br />
There are over 600 challenges so expect to take more time than Hackerrank. Doing 1 challenge a day should keep you busy for a few years. In the meantime, you may want to work on something else concurrently. <br />
As you may have guessed, the challenges are mainly math based. Expect to guesse work to cut back on time and space. <br />
You may not want to create a repo to store program solutions to each challenge but if you do, you may want to leave a spoiler alert just out of courtesy and keep it private else you risk your account. It'll be your little secret. If you feel the need to post your solution, there is a private forum to do so. <br />
After successfully solving a challenge, the system informs you that you are the nth person to solve the challenge and the challenges difficulty. <br />
Work in progress.</p>
